# Neural Network with Keras on UCI Dataset

This project implements a neural network using TensorFlow Keras to classify data from the UCI dataset. The network is configurable, with options for layers, units per layer, activation functions, and training epochs.

## Features

- Fully connected layers with customizable configurations.
- Uses `adam` optimizer and `SparseCategoricalCrossentropy` loss.
- Outputs classification accuracy and detailed evaluation results.

## Requirements

- Python
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
